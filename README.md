# üèè IPL Match Bidding App ‚Äì SQL Queries & Analysis  

## üìå Overview  
This repository contains a comprehensive SQL-based analysis of **IPL Match Bidding System**. The project focuses on **bidding trends, match statistics, and team performances**. Below is a list of **analytical questions** along with their respective **SQL queries** to extract meaningful insights.

---

## üìä Sample SQL Queries & Analysis  

---


### üèÜ 1. Show the percentage of wins of each bidder in the order of highest to lowest percentage.
```sql
SELECT bd.BidderId, bd.Bidder_name, 
       (SUM(CASE WHEN b.BidStatus = 'Won' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*)) AS Win_Percentage
FROM IPL_Bidder_Details bd
JOIN IPL_Bidding_Details b ON bd.BidderId = b.BidderId
GROUP BY bd.BidderId, bd.Bidder_name
ORDER BY Win_Percentage DESC;
```

---

### üèüÔ∏è 2. Display the number of matches conducted at each stadium with the stadium name and city.
```sql
SELECT s.Stadium_name, s.City, COUNT(m.MatchId) AS Total_Matches
FROM IPL_Stadium s
JOIN IPL_Match_Schedule ms ON s.StadiumId = ms.StadiumId
JOIN IPL_Match m ON ms.MatchId = m.MatchId
GROUP BY s.Stadium_name, s.City;
```

---

### üé≤ 3. In a given stadium, what is the percentage of wins by a team that has won the toss?
```sql
SELECT m.TossWinner, COUNT(*) AS Total_Toss_Wins,
       (SUM(CASE WHEN m.TossWinner = m.MatchWinner THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*)) AS Win_Percentage
FROM IPL_Match m
GROUP BY m.TossWinner;

### üé∞ 4. Show the total bids along with the bid team and team name.
```sql
SELECT b.BidTeam, t.Team_name, COUNT(*) AS Total_Bids
FROM IPL_Bidding_Details b
JOIN IPL_Team t ON b.BidTeam = t.TeamId
GROUP BY b.BidTeam, t.Team_name;
```

---

### üèÖ 5. Show the team ID who won the match as per the win details.
```sql
SELECT MatchId, MatchWinner AS Winning_Team_ID
FROM IPL_Match;
```

---

### üìä 6. Display the total matches played, total matches won, and total matches lost by the team along with its team name.
```sql
SELECT t.Team_name, 
       ts.Matches_played, ts.Matches_won, ts.Matches_lost
FROM IPL_Team_Standings ts
JOIN IPL_Team t ON ts.TeamId = t.TeamId;
```

---

### üéØ 7. Display the bowlers for the Mumbai Indians team.

SELECT p.Player_name, tp.Player_role 
FROM IPL_Player p
JOIN IPL_Team_Players tp ON p.PlayerId = tp.PlayerId
JOIN IPL_Team t ON tp.TeamId = t.TeamId

    SELECT BidderId, Bidder_name, YEAR(BidDate) AS Year, MONTH(BidDate) AS Month, SUM(Total_points) AS Total_Points
    FROM IPL_Bidder_Points
    WHERE YEAR(BidDate) = 2017
    GROUP BY BidderId, Bidder_name, YEAR(BidDate), MONTH(BidDate)
) AS SubQuery
ORDER BY Total_Points DESC, Month ASC;
```

---

### üèÜ 15. Get the top 3 and bottom 3 bidders based on total bidding points for 2018.
```sql
(SELECT BidderId, Bidder_name, Total_points FROM IPL_Bidder_Points WHERE YEAR(BidDate) = 2018 ORDER BY Total_points DESC LIMIT 3)
UNION
(SELECT BidderId, Bidder_name, Total_points FROM IPL_Bidder_Points WHERE YEAR(BidDate) = 2018 ORDER BY Total_points ASC LIMIT 3);
```

---

### üéì 16. Create tables for student details and backup with a trigger.

FOR EACH ROW INSERT INTO Student_details_backup VALUES (NEW.Student_id, NEW.Student_name, NEW.mail_id, NEW.mobile_no);
```
